 
# Introduction
As excitons have higher photo-emission rates than free carriers in semiconductors, highly efficient light-emitting devices utilizing excitons are expected. Our exciton dynamics simulation model based on phononic, electronic, and radiative processes, named the phononic–excitonic–radiative (PXR) model, is available to analyze the dynamics under both thermal equilibrium and nonequilibrium states.
According to Ref. [-], the population transitions to upper levels of excitons reduce the radiative recombination rate of excitons in a three-dimensional (3D) space. In bulk crystals, the rates of the radiative deexcitation and exciton-formation transitions from the continuum are lower than 0.01% of the phononic transition rates.

## Energy eigenstates
Table * shows Mott densities of excitons with $n_{//}$ under two conditions of our simulation. The wavefunction of an exciton state is denoted as \[display-eq\], where $inline-eq$ is the 2D-exciton wavefunction confined in a QW; ${R}_//$ and ${r}_//$ are the coordinate vectors of the CM and relative motions of the electron and hole of a 2D exciton, respectively; ${K}_{X//}$ is the wavevector of the 2D exciton; and $ν_{//}$ represents a set of quantum numbers specifying an excitonic quantum state. The wavefunction $inline-eq$ is obtained from the Schrödinger equation of 2D excitons, which is given by \[display-eq\]. The respective $∇_{{R}_{//}}$ and $∇_{{r}_{//}}$ are the nabla differential operators with respect to the components of the vectors ${R}_{//}$ and ${r}_{//}$. $e_0$ is the elementary charge. The effective dielectric constant $ε_{s}$ is $e_0^2/[4πa_{X//}^{2D}E_{B}(1)]$, where respective $a_{X//}^{2D}$ and $E_{B}(1)$ are the 2D-$1S$-exciton Bohr radius and binding energy. Here, Equation (*) can be analytically solved by the method of separation of variables of ${R}_{//}$ and ${r}_{//}$ as follows: \[display-eq\], where $S_X$ is the normalization area of excitons. $ϕ_{S_X}^{{K}_{X//}}({R}_{//})$ is the 2D-plane wave defined as Equation (*) of $inline-eq$, and $S=S_X$. $ψ_{ν_{//}}({r}_{//})$ is the 2D-hydrogen-atom wavefunction determined by a set of two quantum numbers $ν_{//}=(n_{//},m_{//})$, where respective $n_{//}$ $(=1,2,\dots)$ and $m_{//}$ are the principal quantum number and the azimuthal quantum number, which are integers satisfying $|m_{//}|<n_{//}$.
The total energy of the exciton state with ${K}_{X//}$ and $n_{//}$ is given by \[display-eq\], where $inline-eq$ is the kinetic energy of 2D excitons. $inline-eq$ is the binding energy of a 2D exciton with $n_{//}$. The 2D-$1S$-exciton binding energy $E_{B}(1)$ is four times larger than the 3D-$1S$-exciton binding energy $E_{{B}//}^{3D}$. Figure * shows the energy levels of 2D excitons and continuum states.
